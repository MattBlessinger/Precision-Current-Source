# Precision-Current-Source
Precision current source for calibrating multimeters, ammeters, current shunts, etc.

Design: 
The current source is based on an electronic load in which an op amp sets a precise voltage drop across precision resistors via the mosfet's gate voltage. To maintain precision, the set-point voltage is constant and sourced by the MAX6070 low-noise, high-precision voltage reference. Different currents are selected by changing the shunt resistors with a pin header jumper.
